# 🌼 DAISY – Data Analysis & Intelligence System (Healthcare Edition)

> **"Transforming Patient Data into Lifesaving Insights"**

## 📌 Overview
**DAISY (Data Analysis & Intelligence System)** is a comprehensive, end-to-end data science framework designed specifically for the **Healthcare Domain**. Its primary mission is to analyze complex medical datasets, uncover hidden epidemiological trends, and provide predictive insights that can improve patient outcomes and optimize hospital resource allocation.

In an era where healthcare data is growing exponentially, DAISY serves as a bridge between raw clinical data and actionable medical intelligence. By leveraging statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning, DAISY aims to assist healthcare professionals and administrators in making data-driven decisions.

## 🏥 Problem Statement
The healthcare industry generates massive amounts of data daily—from patient electronic health records (EHR) to diagnostic imaging. However, this data is often underutilized due to its complexity. Key challenges include:
* **Predicting Disease Outbreaks:** Early detection of rising cases.
* **Patient Readmission:** Identifying high-risk patients likely to return to the hospital.
* **Resource Management:** Predicting bed and staff requirements.
* **Personalized Care:** Segmenting patients for targeted treatment plans.

**DAISY** addresses these challenges by processing historical data to forecast future health events and trends.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
* **Disease Prediction:** Build models to predict the likelihood of chronic diseases (e.g., Diabetes, Heart Disease) based on clinical parameters.
* **Trend Analysis:** Analyze historical medical data to identify seasonal disease spikes and long-term health trends.
* **Patient Risk Stratification:** Classify patients into risk groups (Low, Medium, High) to prioritize care.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Provide insights to reduce hospital wait times and optimize bed occupancy.
* **Explainable AI:** Ensure that predictive insights are interpretable for medical staff.

## 📊 Expected Insights
By the end of this project, DAISY will provide:
1.  **Risk Factors:** Identification of the top 5 biomarkers contributing to heart failure in the dataset.
2.  **Patient Segments:** Clustering of patients based on comorbidity profiles.
3.  **Accuracy Metrics:** A predictive model with >85% recall (prioritizing minimizing False Negatives in medical diagnosis).
4.  **Resource Forecast:** Prediction of peak admission periods to aid staffing.
